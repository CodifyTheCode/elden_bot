# Elden Bot

This repository contains the work in progress code for Elden Bot. Elden Bot is an attempt to get an AI to play the game Elden Ring. There are a number of challenges to this, and the current focus is to use supervised learning to train a visual machine learning agent to be Margit. Video information can be found here:
